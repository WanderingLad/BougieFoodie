##BOUGIE FOODIE

#The idea for BougieFoodie came about as a means to not only learn about the process 
of making any given dish, but also having a convenient space to learn about the cultural and
historical relevance as well.

Much was learned about fetching API's in general for use as well as the whole project
being a great exercise in teamwork and communication.

Simply type in what you want in the search bar and be presented with a relevant
wikipedia article on the subject as well as a choice of 4 youtube videos to be a 
learning tool.


##USAGE

1.Once you enter our website click on the main search bar 

2.Type in a cuisine of your choice that you would like to learn how to make or are interested in and click on the "search" button, a video and wikipedia page should open up showing you how to make the cuisine and a wikipedia page showing origin of the dish 

3.If you are interested click on the youtube video to watch it, a button to the left should also show your previous searches 

4.If you are interested in your previous searches you can click on them and they will show up as well
