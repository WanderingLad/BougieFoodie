#BOUGIE FOODIE

##The idea for BougieFoodie came about as a means to not only learn about the process 
of making any given dish, but having a convenient space right there to learn about the cultural and
historical relevance as well.

Much was learned about fetching API's in general for use as well as the whole project
being a great exercise in teamwork and communication.

Simply type in what you want in the search bar and be presented with a relevant
wikipedia article on the subject as well as a choice of 4 youtube videos to be a 
learning tool.

##CREDITS

Jimmy Reilly, Marvin Bolanos, Stephanie Mathis and Michael Marlowe all collaborated 
in a joint effort to bring the site to full functionality.
